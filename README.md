## Why CardioRural ❤️‍🩺
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality in Canada, with rural communities accouting for 73% of country wide cases due to limited access to early screening and preventive care.

**CardioRural bridges this gap by:**
- Using simple, clinically relevant inputs to estimate cardiovascular risk
- Delivering personalized, actionable lifestyle recommendations
- Running on mobile-friendly platforms with potential for offline use in low-connectivity settings

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Risk Assessment Engine** – Predicts heart disease risk (Low, Moderate, High)
- **Mobile-First Design** – Optimized for smartphones and tablets to support use in rural and remote settings
- **Personalized Recommendations** – Provides tailored lifestyle guidance based on individual risk profiles
- **Offline Capability (Planned)** – Designed for future use in low-connectivity environments
- **Open-Source Architecture** – Transparent, extensible, and adaptable for community and research use

- ## 🧪 How It Works

CardioRural uses a trained machine learning model to estimate cardiovascular disease risk and deliver actionable insights.

</p>.

### Workflow
1. Users input basic clinical and demographic data via a mobile-friendly interface  
2. Inputs are preprocessed through the trained pipeline  
3. The model generates a cardiovascular risk estimate  
4. Results are presented clearly, alongside personalized lifestyle recommendations  

### Planned Upgrades
- Development of **population-tailored models** for African and other underrepresented populations  
- Integration of **real-world community health data** to improve model accuracy and relevance

  ## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Streamlit** 📱 — Interactive, mobile-friendly web interface  
- **Pandas** 📊 — Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖 — Machine learning modeling and preprocessing
  
## 🛤️ Roadmap

- ✅ MVP application live and functional  
- ⬜ Local language support (english, french)  
- ⬜ SMS-based access for low-connectivity regions   
- ⬜ Collaboration with NGOs and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) for real-world deployment
